# New-Representation-RWA
A new method to name all sort of RWA available in the state-of-art; and not even that, stablished a path to name all possible number and combinations, which may be convenient while working with a big number of actuators and RWA as well.

## Year: 2023 - 2024.

## Description. 

The reaction wheels are powerful actuators that are increasing in use and features. They are commonly found in groups called Reaction Wheel Arrays (RWA), which they adopt in order to control the attitude of airplanes, aircrafts and satellites. 

# Problem Definition.

## Reaction Wheel Array (RWA)

An example of the importance of this project: how to name and properly indentificate this array if it has multiple reaction wheels and different tilt angles?
